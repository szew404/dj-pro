modular and scalable architecture, facilitating and optimizing the development time.
Through CLI commands, you will be able to include configuration options such as:
``Django Rest Framework`` configuration for further API development. ``Unfold`` setup
and configuration for a customization of the Django Admin Site theme.
``Docker`` configuration from an early stage of development to facilitate
future deployment.

Using ``djpro`` you can stop creating the directories of your Django project
from scratch.
